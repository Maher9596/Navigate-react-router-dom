# Navigate-react-router-dom
Used the Navigate component from react-router-dom

In React V6 (Redirect) component is not supported anymore
The Navigate can replace Redirect in many cases with some limitations.
In this example I have mimicked a very basic login logic and redirecting to a specific route on success.
